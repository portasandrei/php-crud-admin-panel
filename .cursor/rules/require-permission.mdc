# No Changes Without Permission

- **Do not** edit, change, delete, or add any files, code, or folders without the user's explicit permission.
- Before making any modification to the project (edits, new files, deletions, new folders), ask for confirmation or wait for the user to request the change.
- Explanations, suggestions, and showing example code in the chat are allowed; applying those changes to the repo is not unless the user approves.
